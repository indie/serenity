<h3>Mission</h3>

   <p>A website with mission statement?  But of course! </p>

   <p>OHinAA's mission is pretty simple: </p>  
    <p> (1) to share words of experience, strength, hope, inspiration, wisdom and humor among members of the fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous and/or Narcotics Anonymous  </p>
    <p> (2) to provide a safe place where people can "learn" about AA / NA via the words of our members.  AA is based on "attraction, rather than promotion"; we are hopeful that the words here can encourage people to get to meetings and share what they hear </p> 
    <p> (3) to protect and respect each member's anonymity at whatever level they wish to be anonymous; for this reason the stream is available via login only </p>
